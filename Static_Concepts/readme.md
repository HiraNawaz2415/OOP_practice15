## **1. What is a Static Function?**
**Definition:**
- A static function in a class belongs to the class itself, not to any object.
That means:
- You can call it without creating an object
- It can only access static members of the class

---
## **2. What is a Static Variable in a Class?**
- Shared by all objects of the class
- Memory is allocated only once

---
## **3. What is a Static Class?**
- In C++, you cannot directly create a static class like in C#. But you can simulate it by making:
- All members static
- Private constructor to prevent object creation

---

## **What is the this Pointer?**
- In C++, every object of a class has its own data.

- When you call a member function using an object, the compiler automatically passes a hidden pointer called this.

**Simple Definition:**
- **this pointer** is a special pointer inside class functions that points to the current object (the one calling the function).

- **Why Use this?**
- To refer to current objectâ€™s members (useful when local variable names are same as class variables)

- To return the current object (in method chaining)

# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

This repository contains concepts, examples, and exercises related to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. It is designed for beginners and intermediate learners to understand how to structure C++ programs using OOP principles.

## Credits

This repository and all the example code were created with the guidance and support of **Sir IRFAN ULLAH**, who taught me C++ during my course.  

I am thankful for his clear explanations and hands-on practice sessions which helped me understand important concepts like **operator overloading , polymorphism etc all oop concepts** .

**He is really hardworking and great teacher. **May always be stay bless and his life always be fill with lot of success. Ameen.

Without his help, this learning journey wouldn’t have been so smooth and enjoyable.

## What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of **objects** and **classes**, which makes code more reusable, modular, and maintainable.

## 🔑 Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation means **hiding internal data** and only exposing necessary parts of an object through methods (getters/setters). It helps in protecting the data from unintended changes.

> ✅ Example: Private class members with public getter/setter functions.

### 2. **Abstraction**
Abstraction means **showing only essential details** and hiding the complex implementation. It helps in reducing programming complexity.

> ✅ Example: Using abstract classes or interfaces in C++ (pure virtual functions).

### 3. **Inheritance**
Inheritance allows one class (child) to **acquire the properties and behaviors** of another class (parent), promoting code reuse.

> ✅ Example: `class Dog : public Animal { ... };`

### 4. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows the same function or method to **behave differently** based on the object or context, especially using function overriding and overloading.

> ✅ Example: Virtual functions, function overloading.
